\maketitle

\vspace{-8mm} 
I have significant experience as a tech lead and CTO. I can easily
integrate into teams, build teams, and mentor juniors. Very skilled at prototyping,
developing, and modeling. Experienced system engineer and fullstack developer
who enjoys dealing with ambiguity at the interface of design and
implementation.

\cventry{2025 Jan-current}{\textbf{Senior Engineer}, Dognosis, Bengaluru}{}{}{}{
    \cvlistitem{%
        Currently writing a scalable EHR portal for medical record management,
        and an app to automate experiments with cancer-sniffing dogs. 
        Major components includes real-time event processing using distributed
        queues, data APIs, ETL pipelines, and data-storage. Tech used: \emph{Rust,
        Python, PHP8, PostGreSQL, NTFY, VictorialMetrics DB}.
    }
    \cvlistitem{%
        I set up DevOps infrastructure (GitLab, cicd, Sentry) and observability
        stack (OpenTelemetry, Grafana), and backup services. Implemented
        DevSecOps. I also conduct technical interviews.
    }

\cventry{2019-2024}{\textbf{CoFounder \& CTO}, Subconscious Compute, Bengaluru}{}{}{}{
    \cvlistitem{%
        Subsconsious compute is a pre series-A endpoint cybersecurity startup. I cofounded
        it after my PhD and lead the developed of its flagship endpoint security 
        product Shepherd. 
        I hired and managed a team of 15 engineers for writing a cross platform
        endpoint-security solution that includes an agent, data-collection APIs,
        databases, and single pane of glass.
    }
    \cvlistitem{%
        As IC, I wrote kernel minifilter (C++, Win32) and contributed to endpoint 
        observability agent (Rust, C++, Java) for cross-platform (Linux, Windows, OSX, 
        Android) deployment.
    }

        \href{https://moose.ncbs.res.in}{MOOSE}.
    }
    \cvlistitem{%
        Added SBML support to \href{https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose}{MOOSE
        Simulator} for reusing the existing models, and modernized build system
        using CMake for cross-platform build. I also helped porting HSolver to GPU 
        using CUDA to speed up numerical computation.
